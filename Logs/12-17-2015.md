  - Installing Linux Mint

  - Intro to Erlang
    - Erlang is a functional programming language
    - Erlang uses an "Actor Model" to make processes parallel.
      - Processes communicate through messages, which allows for realtime updating, and allows processes to crash instead of dealing with errors.
    - Erlang is great for back-end due to these properties, but it's also been used for the telephone network, and some robotics stuff.
    - Erlang is a compiled language.
  - Interactive Erlang Shell
    - Use the `$ erl` command to start it.
    - Type `> q().` to quit.
    - Type `> help().` for help.
  - `ctrl+G` goes to the _User Switch Command_ to move between processes.
    - `h` for help
    - `j` to list processes
    - `c` to connect
  - Basic Syntax
    - All statements end with a period and a whitespace `.\w`, much like English.
    - All variables begin with an uppercase letter or and underscore.
      - Underscore can be bound multiple times. `_ = 4. _ = 5. _. //5`
    - You cannot bind a value to a variable more than once.
      - `X = 3. X = 4.//** exception error: no match of right hand side value`
    - Basic Types(Will probably increase):
      - atoms (booleans are atoms)
      - numbers
      - Tuples
      - lists (strings are lists)
      - bytestuff, forgot the name(Kind of like arrays, will most likely never be used practically)
    - Erlang for the most part doesn't differentiate between number types(int/float).
      - `5 == 5.0 // true`
      - Different bases like so `16#FF00FF. //16711935`
    - Common Arithmetic Operators:
      - `+`, `-`, `/`, `*`, `div`(int/int division), `rem`(like %).
    - Comparison Operators:
      - `=:=`, `=/=`, `==`, `/=`, `>=`, `=<` , `>`, `<`
      - `=:=` and `=/=` are type strict(for numbers) while the proceeding two are not.
    - Tuples
      - Declaration `Vector3 = {1,2,3}.` or `{X,Y,Z} = Vector3.` or `{X2, Y2, Z2} = {1,2,3}.`
      - You can use underscore for values you don't care about. `{_,_,Z} = Vector3.`
      - The number of values in the tuple need to be the same. `{_,Z} = Vector3. ////** exception error: no match of right hand side value`
    - Lists
      - Declaration `List = [1,2,3]. `
      - Lists are kind of like tuples.
      - Lists can be jagged, mixed type, and nested. `[1, {1,2,3}, "hoge"].`
      - Strings are lists. `[65,66,67]. // "ABC"`
      - You can use the `hd(list)` and `tl(list)` commands to get the head and tail of a list.
      - You can add stuff to the head of a list like `[head/s | tail-list].`
    - List Comprehensions
      - Syntax: `[mapFunc(X) || X <- list, filter(X)]`
      - Example: `[X*X || X <- [1,2,3,4,5,6], X rem 2 =:= 0]. //[4,16,36]`
    - bytestring/bit syntax
      - `Color = 16#FF00FF. Pixel = <<Color:24>>. // <<255,0,255>>`
      - `<<Color:24>>.` This means to store Color in 24 bits of data, since the unit of data is 8 bits, it splits into 3.
      - There's a bunch of other stuff that could be done but it seems like a lot of effort and not really worth the time.
      - Apparently strings are sometimes stored like this.
