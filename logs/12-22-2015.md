#### Attendees: Rikuo
#### Resource used: _Learn You Some Erlang for Great Good!_

#### What we learned:

- Compiling code
  - `$ erlc filename.erl`  to compile all `filename.erl` files in the current directory from commandline.
    - options:
      - `-debug_info` for debugging.
      - `-o outdir` to set the output directory of compiled file, directory needs to exist.
      - `-export_all` to ignore `-export(hogehoge).` and export everything.
  - `c(modulename).` or `compile:file(modulename)` in the shell to compile modules temporarily during the session.
    - use `cd("directory/name/")` to change working directory before running the compile function.
    - `modulename` is an atom, `"directoryname"` is a string.
    - `c("directory/filename")` works as well.
  - You need the compiled `.beam` files in the working directory to use them.
- See module meta data by using the `modulename:module_info().` function.
  - It comes in JSON format.
  - `modulename:module_info(thing).` looks for a specific `thing` under the meta data.
  - Adding attributes like `-author("Ham Taro").` puts them under `modulename:module_info(attributes).`.
- Avoid circular dependencies since it's kinda like incest.
- Pattern Match instead of if/else
   ```erlang:hoge.erl
    -compile(export_all).

    func(X) -> Expression;
    func(Y) -> Expression.
  ```
  - Use semi-colon to separate _function clauses_ to form a _function declaration_
  - Use the `_` unbound variable to declare the "else" statement.
- Guards
  ```erlang:hoge.erl
  func(X) when X >= 16, X <= 104 ->  true;
  func(_) -> false.

  func2(X) when X < 16 ; X > 104 -> true;
  func2(X) -> false.
  ```
  - the `when` keyword allows you to limit X, using what's known as _guards_.
  - you can use multiple guards like an && operator using a comma `,` and use a semi-colon `;` like a || operator.
  - you __cannot__ use user defined functions as guards
  - you can, however, use some functions(ex: `is_integer/1` and `is_atom/1`), as well as math operators, and comparison operators.
- If statements look terrible I'm going to bed.

#### Other things of note:
Met this kid Katano again, really geeky guy that's into biology. Really smart and he talks a lot. There are people that don't talk much but they know a lot. There's also people that talk a lot and know even more. There's also people who don't talk because they don't know much, or they talk a lot but they don't even know what they're talking about. Not sure what category this guy is in.

I'm also doing erlang at Tokyo Hackerspace, it's been a while since I've been here.
